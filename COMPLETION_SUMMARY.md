## 🎯 OOP Concepts Covered

### Core Concepts ✅
- [x] Classes and Objects
- [x] Attributes (Instance & Class)
- [x] Methods (Instance, Class, Static)
- [x] Constructors (`__init__`)
- [x] The `self` keyword

### The 4 Pillars ✅
- [x] **Encapsulation**: Private attributes, properties, getters/setters
- [x] **Inheritance**: Single, multiple, method overriding, `super()`
- [x] **Polymorphism**: Method overriding, duck typing, operator overloading
- [x] **Abstraction**: Abstract classes, interfaces, ABC module

### Advanced Topics ✅
- [x] Magic Methods (dunder methods)
- [x] Properties and Decorators
- [x] Class Methods (`@classmethod`)
- [x] Static Methods (`@staticmethod`)
- [x] Composition vs Inheritance
- [x] Method Resolution Order (MRO)
- [x] Context Managers
- [x] Enums and Type Hints
