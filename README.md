# Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Tutorial

Complete guide to mastering OOP in Python with hands-on examples and exercises.

## What is Object-Oriented Programming?

OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects" that contain:
- **Data** (attributes/properties)
- **Code** (methods/functions)

### Why Learn OOP?

- Write more organized, reusable code
- Model real-world entities
- Easier to maintain and scale
- Industry standard for large applications

## The 4 Pillars of OOP

### 1. Encapsulation
Bundle data and methods together, hide internal details

### 2. Inheritance
Create new classes based on existing ones

### 3. Polymorphism
Same interface, different implementations

### 4. Abstraction
Hide complex implementation, show only essentials

## Learning Path

### Week 1: Fundamentals
- **Day 1-2**: Classes and Objects
- **Day 3-4**: Attributes and Methods
- **Day 5-6**: Encapsulation
- **Day 7**: Practice Exercises

### Week 2: Core Concepts
- **Day 8-9**: Inheritance
- **Day 10-11**: Polymorphism
- **Day 12-13**: Abstraction
- **Day 14**: Practice Exercises

### Week 3: Advanced Topics
- **Day 15-16**: Magic Methods
- **Day 17-18**: Properties and Decorators
- **Day 19-20**: Class Methods and Static Methods
- **Day 21**: Advanced Concepts

### Week 4: Projects
- **Day 22-24**: Bank System Project
- **Day 25-27**: Library Management Project
- **Day 28-30**: Game Characters Project

## Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd python-oop-tutorial

# Start with Lesson 1
python lessons/01_classes_and_objects.py

# Or run all lessons
python run_all_lessons.py
```

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge (variables, functions, loops, conditionals)
- Python 3.7 or higher

## Key Concepts Covered

### Basic Concepts
- Classes and Objects
- Instance vs Class Attributes
- Instance vs Class Methods
- Constructor (`__init__`)
- `self` keyword

### Encapsulation
- Private attributes (`_` and `__`)
- Getters and Setters
- Property decorators
- Data hiding

### Inheritance
- Single Inheritance
- Multiple Inheritance
- Method Resolution Order (MRO)
- `super()` function
- Method Overriding

### Polymorphism
- Method Overriding
- Duck Typing
- Operator Overloading
- Abstract Base Classes

### Abstraction
- Abstract Classes
- Abstract Methods
- Interfaces (Python style)
- Hiding Implementation

### Advanced Topics
- Magic Methods (`__str__`, `__repr__`, `__eq__`, etc.)
- Properties (`@property`)
- Class Methods (`@classmethod`)
- Static Methods (`@staticmethod`)
- Composition vs Inheritance
- SOLID Principles
- Design Patterns

## Real-World Examples

Each lesson uses practical examples:
- Banking system (accounts, transactions)
- E-commerce (products, shopping cart)
- School system (students, teachers, courses)
- Game development (characters, weapons, inventory)
- Social media (users, posts, comments)

## Exercises

### Beginner (15 exercises)
- Create basic classes
- Add methods and attributes
- Practice encapsulation

### Intermediate (15 exercises)
- Implement inheritance
- Use polymorphism
- Create abstract classes

### Advanced (10 exercises)
- Complex class hierarchies
- Multiple inheritance
- Design patterns

## Projects

### Project 1: Bank Account System
Build a complete banking system with:
- Different account types
- Transactions
- Interest calculation
- Account management

### Project 2: Library Management
Create a library system with:
- Books and members
- Borrowing system
- Late fees
- Search functionality

### Project 3: RPG Game Characters
Develop a game character system with:
- Different character classes
- Inventory system
- Combat mechanics
- Level progression

## Tips for Learning

1. **Type the code yourself** - Don't copy-paste
2. **Run each example** - See the output
3. **Experiment** - Modify the code and see what happens
4. **Complete exercises** - Practice is key
5. **Build projects** - Apply what you learned
6. **Debug errors** - Learn from mistakes

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Forgetting `self` parameter
- Not calling `super().__init__()`
- Confusing class vs instance attributes
- Overusing inheritance
- Not using encapsulation
- Making everything a class
